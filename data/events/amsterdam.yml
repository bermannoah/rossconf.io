After 15 minute introductions to the project, pressing issues and requests, the conference day is reserved for hands-on programming (or contributing through updating documentation or adding artwork!) and pairing with the maintainers. To conclude the hackathon the maintainers present data on bugs fixed, and pull requests merged.</p>'
